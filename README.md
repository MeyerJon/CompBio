# Project Game Theory

This project uses game theory to simulate the evolution of 2 populations with 2 strategies within each population.

## Configuration file
The example configuration contains the necessary parameters and equations to simulate the coexistence of fungi partners and hosts.

Here the inputs are a 2x2 matrix that represents the payoff-matrix, the 2 populations with their respective sizes and strategies.
Lastly simulation parameters are used to define granularity and amount of days to simulate.

## 
The simulation can be executed using 

python3 main.py

This creates a pop_dynamic.eps plot for the example configuration.
